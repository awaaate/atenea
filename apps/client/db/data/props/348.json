    "description": "To celebrate the two-year anniversary of Nouns DAO, we're proud to submit 8 new heads and 2 new accessories for approval and addition to the protocol. The 10 traits are creations by Amiyoko, Facu, Goldy, Index, Krel, and Tummlin, a group of six passionate contributors to the noundry community. The group came together with a mission to design, refine, and curate a selection of traits worthy of addition to the Nouns collection. We propose to continue the tradition of adding to the Nouns body of artwork on the project's anniversary, August 8. See last year's art upgrade proposal (125) for reference. Below are the final traits as well as a birds-eye-view of the work that went into creating the selection. Additionally, this Figma document functioned as the heart of ideation and alignment throughout the process.",
