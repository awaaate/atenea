    "description": "It's an interesting idea and I don't think the original proposer should have cancelled. I also think it's contradictory for the DeFi oriented DAO participants to advocate radical experimentation in the realm of financial engineering, governance pools, and so forth and then lambast culture-oriented participants as being irresponsible for making equally bold moves in the realm of cultural expertise. There are CT friends that I respect both FOR and AGAINST this prop and I think we should put it to a vote and let the DAO decide. I thought the previous bid was too high, so I'm resubmitting at 4769. Good luck to all parties!",
