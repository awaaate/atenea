Each Noun-holding wallet will be airdropped a Matr Labs token that can be redeemed for a physical. We will update the metadata of the token upon redemption with a hi-res image of the Matr'd Noun, which will provide a digital Certificate of Authenticity for each physical piece of art. We will promote this effort through social channels and allocate secondary royalties of the Matr Labs x Nouns token to the Nouns treasury.",
