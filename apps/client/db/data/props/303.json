The area surrounding the skatepark is predominantly low-income, with many at-risk youths with few recreational opportunities. Together with the local Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation, we will unlock the potential of Silverado Skatepark to create a space that will benefit Long Beach area skaters, youth, and community members for generations to come.",
