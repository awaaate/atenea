    "description": "This proposal is a continuation of proposals 327 and 328. 328 was not properly executed and all of the NAC eth was transferred back to the nouns treasury. As such, I am proposing that we approve a final 50 eth payment to complete the purchase of this sculpture. As detailed below, we will then submit a new proposal for the first placement of the sculpture at Zero Bond in New York City.\n\nPrevious proposal text:\n\nIn April 2022 the Nouns DAO voted on and executed Proposal 48 - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin, wherein the Brooklyn-based artist was commissioned to update the Leviathan image by creating PERSON, PLACE, or THING, a new sculptural portrait layering each Nouns avatar into one fantastic body. For the commission, Yellin hand painted the 402 Nouns minted in Year One, integrating them into a unique glass artwork to forge a record of the history of the Nouns DAO, while branding its newest emblem.\n\nMuch like a yearbook, a ship’s manifest, or the signatures under a document, this snapshot provides a freeze frame of the DAO’s founders and builders. This in-all-is-one super-avatar represents the shared vision and trust between all stakeholders, while providing a rallying banner - an art object - that crystalizes how individuals are more powerful when they come together, and how a community can achieve the seemingly impossible by focusing its collective resources and talents around a common task.\n\nUpon acceptance of Proposal 48, the Nouns DAO compensated the artist with an initial deposit of 50ETH and made a donation of 100,000 USDC to the non-profit cultural center, Pioneer Works.\n\nA second payment of 50ETH and 1 Noun NFT (Noun 252 from the Nouns treasury) was agreed to be paid upon completion of the PERSON, PLACE, or THING sculpture and its accompanying NFT.\n\nLink to images of the finished sculpture: https://www.dustinyellin.com/d/6afb72\nLink to the NFT: Psychoprogeny - https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3dde7d56735d5ab659544070679e9350d23d5b0b/2\n\nUpon acceptance of this proposal, the NFT for PERSON, PLACE, or THING will be transferred from DustinYellinDeployer to a Nouns DAO wallet.\n\nDustin Yellin Studio will then submit a new proposal to Nouns DAO requesting 12ETH to cover the expense of crating, transporting, and installing the 3,000 lb sculpture in the foyer of the main dining room of the Manhattan social club, Zero Bond, and back to the artist's studio at the conclusion of the loan period.
