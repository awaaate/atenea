    "description": "This proposal increases the proposal threshold from 25 -> 30bps. Success of this proposal means 3 Nouns are required to submit a proposal to the DAO until Noun 1000. This is approximately ~263 days^.\n\nBy increasing the proposal threshold, we should expect an overall reduction in the number of proposals submitted. While this may lead to a lower number of submitted proposals, widespread use of delegation will allow the highest quality proposals to be submitted, and sufficiently mitigate these concerns. An additional benefit is a lower risk of voter fatigue.\n\n^ At the time of this proposal it is currently Noun 707. The proposal threshold would be >3 at Noun 1000. There are 293 Nouns until then. At a minting rate of 1.1 a day (accounting the for the Nounder reward), this results in approximately 263 days.",
