    "description": "Bulls and Bears make money, Arbs get slaughtered. It's an excellent idea and I don't think 4156, or the original proposer should have canceled. I also think it's contradictory for the DeFi oriented DAO participants to advocate radical experimentation in the realm of financial engineering, governance pools, and so forth and then lambast culture-oriented participants as being irresponsible for making equally bold moves in the realm of cultural expertise. There are CT friends that I respect both FOR and AGAINST this prop, and I think we should put it to a vote and let the DAO decide. I also thought the previous proposals to make a bid was a 'one foot in, one foot out' position, so I'm resubmitting the proposal as a 'buyPunk' transaction. Good luck to all parties!",
