    "description": "I propose to grow a community of software and hardware developers around Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook (aka breadboard). The Noun-Devices will be available in the $40-$60 price range and distributed strictly using a fixed price policy to ensure that the end users do not overpay. NounsDAO can sponsor ETH Hackathons by providing the first 400 Noun-Computer kits. Also, 30% of the supply will be allocated to Nouns-Computer Fund any nouner will be able to request computers for Public Good via an on-chain proposal and send it to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes.",
