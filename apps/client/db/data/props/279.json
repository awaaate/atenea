    "description": "The purpose of this proposal is to request a grant to launch ethOS devices for purchase. We have been building ethOS, a free and open source mobile OS that embraces Ethereum and makes Web3 delightful on mobile. Currently, using ethOS requires flashing an older Pixel device, which is a major impediment to adoption. With the grant, we plan to make ethOS available pre-installed on current Pixel 7s and establish a user-friendly sales process. The first ethOS device will also have a Nounish Edition to thank NounsDAO for their support.",
